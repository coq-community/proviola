Proviola, a tool for proof reanimation.

Usage:
======
Run coqdoc on your sources, run the camera.py script on the generated HTML file. Optionally provide an output file.
On the generated xml file (default extension: .flm), run an XSL processor such as xsltproc (linux) to get an HTML page.
The default XSL template is proviola/coq/proviola.xsl, which includes the required JavaScript and CSS.

There is a known bug in processing 'plain' scripts, not pre-processed by Coqdoc.


Dependencies: 
=============
- The lxml library.  (lxml.de)
