Proviola, a tool for proof reanimation.

- Description: TODO

- Dependencies: requires a stable installation of the BeautifulSoup library (the 3.2 branch), as can be found at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/BeautifulSoup/3.2.0 . 

Do *not* use the 3.1 branch provided in aptitude, as this branch is buggy and won't work with the Proviola.
